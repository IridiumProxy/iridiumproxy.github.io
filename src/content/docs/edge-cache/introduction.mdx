Iridium supports edge caching for static files. You can enable edge caching in the configuration file by setting the `edge_cache.enabled` option to `true`. This option can be applied globally or per host.

Because edge caching stores files in memory, make sure your server has enough RAM to handle the cached files.

<Aside type="tip">
  When Edge Caching is enabled, Iridium will automatically add a `X-Cache: HIT` or a `X-Cache: MISS` header to the response, indicating whether the response was served from the cache or not.
</Aside>

## Caching Time

If not specified, the caching time will be taken from the `Cache-Control` header of the response. If the header is not present, a default caching time of 1 hour (3600 seconds) will be used.

This can be configured in the `edge_cache.duration` option in the configuration file (in seconds).

## Clearing the Cache

You can clear the entire edge cache by restarting the Iridium server.
