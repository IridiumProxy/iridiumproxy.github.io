To secure your website and ensure data integrity, it's essential to configure TLS (Transport Layer Security) properly. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up TLS for Iridium.

## Obtaining a Certificate

To enable TLS, you need a valid and trusted TLS certificate. You can obtain a free TLS certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) or purchase one from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

## Configuring TLS

Here's how to configure TLS in your Iridium setup:

<Code lang="yaml" title="config.yaml" code={`
tls:
    cert_file: /path/to/the/fullchain.pem
    key_file: /path/to/the/privkey.pem
`} />

- `cert_file`: This should point to the full chain certificate file provided by your CA. It typically includes your domain's certificate along with any intermediate certificates.
- `key_file`: This should point to the private key file associated with your TLS certificate.

<Aside type="note">
  If Iridium is unable to read the certificate or key files (permission issues, incorrect paths, etc.), it will fail to start. Ensure that Iridium has the necessary permissions to access them.

  If the files do not exist or are empty, Iridium will start normally but without TLS support.
