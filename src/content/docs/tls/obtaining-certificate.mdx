title: Obtaining a TLS Certificate
---

import { Code, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

To enable TLS, you need a valid and trusted TLS certificate. You can obtain a free TLS certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) or purchase one from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

Fortunately, Iridium includes built-in support to generate certificates.

## Self-signed certificate

You can generate a self-signed certificate using the following command:

```bash
iridium cert generate example.com
```

This command will generate two files in the current directory, `example.com.crt` (the certificate) and `example.com.key` (the private key).

<Aside type="caution">
  Self-signed certificates are not trusted by browsers and will result in security warnings. They are suitable for testing or internal use but not recommended for production environments.
</Aside>

## Let's Encrypt

Iridium also includes built-in support for obtaining and renewing certificates from Let's Encrypt. To use this feature, run the following command:

```bash
iridium cert obtain example.com
```

This command will generate two files in the current directory, `example.com.crt` (the certificate) and `example.com.key` (the private key).

## Certificate Configuration

Once you have obtained your TLS certificate and private key, you need to configure Iridium to use them. Update your `config.yaml` file with the paths to your certificate and key files:

<Code lang="yaml" title="config.yaml" code={`
tls:
    cert_file: /path/to/the/certificate.crt
    key_file: /path/to/the/private.key
`} />

- `cert_file`: This should point to the full chain certificate file provided by your CA. It typically includes your domain's certificate along with any intermediate certificates.
- `key_file`: This should point to the private key file associated with your TLS certificate.
