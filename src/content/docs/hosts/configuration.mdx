title: Host Configuration

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

**Iridium manages hosts through configuration files, stored in the `~/.iridium/hosts/` directory (or `%APPDATA%\Iridium\hosts\` on Windows).**

Each host configuration file is a YAML file with a `.yml` extension.

## Configuration File Structure

A host configuration file typically includes the following fields:

<Code code={`
domain: example.com
locations:
  - match: '*'
    proxy: localhost:3000

edge_cache:
  enabled: true
`} lang="yaml" title="hosts/example-host.yml" />

### Fields

- `domain`: The domain name for the host (e.g., `example.com`). Matches with the `Host` header in incoming requests.
- `locations`: A list of location blocks that define how to handle requests based on their path.
  - `match`: A pattern to match the request path (e.g., `*` for all paths, `/api/*` for API routes).
  - `proxy` (optional): The backend service to which requests matching this location should be forwarded (e.g., `localhost:3000`).
  - `root` (optional): The directory from which to serve static files for this location (e.g., `/var/www/html`).
  - `content` (optional): Inline content to serve for this location (e.g., `Hello, World!`).
- `edge_cache`: Configuration for edge caching. See [Edge Caching](/edge-cache/introduction) for more details.
