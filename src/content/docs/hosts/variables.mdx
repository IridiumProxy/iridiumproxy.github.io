## Available Variables

Iridium provides several built-in variables that can be used within host configuration files to customize responses and behavior. These variables can be included in the `content` field of a location block to dynamically insert information about the request or server.

<Code code={`
$user_agent     # The User-Agent string from the client's request headers.
$remote_addr    # The IP address of the client making the request.
$host           # The Host header from the client's request.
$uri            # The request URI (path and query string).
$method         # The HTTP method of the request (e.g., GET, POST).
$scheme         # The scheme of the request (http or https).
`} lang="bash" title="Available Variables" />

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use these variables in a host configuration file:

<Code code={`
domain: example.com
locations:
  - match: '/user-agent'
    content: 'Your user agent is: <code>$user_agent</code>'
  - match: '/ip'
    content: 'Your IP address is: <code>$remote_addr</code>'
`} lang="yaml" title="hosts/variables-example.yml" />
