title: HTTP/2
---

HTTP/2 is a major revision of the HTTP network protocol used by the *World Wide Web*. It was developed to improve the performance and efficiency of web communications, addressing some of the limitations of its predecessor, HTTP/1.1.

Iridium supports HTTP/2, allowing for faster and more efficient loading of web pages and resources.

## Upgrading to HTTP/2

When Iridium is configured to use HTTPS, it automatically supports HTTP/2 without any additional configuration.

Most modern browsers and servers support HTTP/2, so if both the client and server support it, the connection will be upgraded to HTTP/2.
